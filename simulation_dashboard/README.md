The simulation dashboard is a package that is able to
- Display SLURM job info
- Retrieve relevant simulations tied to SLURM jobs
- Interact with python code to execute SLURM jobs based on complex info like:
    - multi-dimensional scan
    - percentage space scales
    - probabilistic next point scans (computationally choose the next simulation based on Bayesian probabilities)
    - load jobs in a queue to execute to SLURM while AFK (away from keyboard)
